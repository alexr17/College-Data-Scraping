Honestly, this whole college application process has been a grind. I hate the fact that college letters want us to sum up ourselves in just a few words and statistics which will determine where we will go for the next four years of our lives. It was even harder for me since Im not a great writer and my stats were not necessarily reflective of my intelligence (as my freshman year GPA definitely hindered me). But what Ive learned from this whole process is you need to take advantage of the fact that youre being asked to bundle yourself into a small packet that is being sent to every college you apply to. Make every word count and truly show that youre passionate. In my case, Ill admit that my essays were borderline generic so I didnt show much passion for CMU, despite how much I wanted to get in.

Word of advice: Work on your essays DURING THE SUMMER or at least start a month before the deadline. Peer and self review can mean the difference between a great essay and one that completely misses the mark. And make sure you get your essays checked by multiple people: people who like you, people who dont like you, people who are good at writing, people who arent good at writing, etc. Youll get opinions on all aspects of your essay.
